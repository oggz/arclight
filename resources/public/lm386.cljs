 [:h2 "LM386 Audio Amplifier"]
 [:p "The LM386 audio amplifier IC from TI has been a goto audio amplifier chip for industry over the past few decades. This is my circuit based on the reference schematic in the datasheet. The reference schematic leaves out a few basic filtering components. The extra filtering brought the noise level down to reasonable margin."]

 [:p "Here is the finished proto board test unit. The noise is within acceptable parameters but could still be improved. The noise may be due to no shielding as well. This will be tested."]
